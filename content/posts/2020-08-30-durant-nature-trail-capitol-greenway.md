The actual park basically only has maybe a quarter mile paved (first con) - just to the bathrooms. But hey - it has bathrooms (first pro)! AND it's walking / biking distance to the Capitol Greenway, which you pass over as you drive into the parking lot. This access is the only reason to go to Durant Nature park if you're wanting to bike or take a stroller. The other trails are for walking - some of it gravel, but most of it is rooty pine straw -at least at the time of year when I went (August).

To get to the greenway you just have to go down the hill from the parking lot and you'll see it. Which brings me to my second con - that hill. I had a rough go biking up it with a trailer attached after doing my entire ride. Ended up having to walk it up halfway. Other than that - the greenway near this park is great - it's all shaded (pro 2). The greenway follows a stream that you can see most of the way (pro 3 - scenic!). I saw a couple 2 ft tall waterfalls that were neat. The roots causing cracks / bumps in the pavement are minimal. It's also not heavily trafficked, especially in the morning before 10am. To follow the greenway, you'll have to cross over a few streets along the way, but they are neighborhood streets (2 lane) - not a ton of vehicle traffic.

Tips for this trail:

Bring bug spray

Trail difficulty: 2 (1-5, 1 being easiest). Gave it a 2 because of the hills leading up to the crossing streets and that last hill back to the parking lot.
