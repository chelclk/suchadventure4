### Overall Rating: 3/5
### Tips for this park:

- Bring bug spray

### Trail difficulty: 2 (1-5, 1 being easiest). 
Gave it a 2 because of the hills leading up to the crossing streets and that last hill back to the parking lot.

Features:

- Playground (OPEN COVID)
- Bathrooms
- Lake view
- Creek view
- Covered picnic tables

#### The trails: 
Durant Nature Park basically only has a quarter mile paved - just to the bathrooms. But hey - it has bathrooms! AND it's walking / biking distance to the Capitol Greenway, which you pass over as you drive into the parking lot. This access is the only reason to go to Durant Nature Park if you're wanting to bike or take a stroller for a long walk. The other trails are for hiking - some of it gravel, but most of it is rooty pine straw (at least at the time of year when I went (August).

To get to the greenway you just have to go down the hill from the parking lot and you'll see it. I had a rough go biking up that hill with a trailer attached after doing my entire ride. Ended up having to walk it up halfway. Other than that - the greenway near this park is great - it's all shaded. The greenway follows a stream that you can see most of the way. I saw a couple 2 ft tall waterfalls that were neat. The roots causing cracks / bumps in the pavement are minimal. It's also not heavily trafficked, especially in the morning before 10am. To follow the greenway, you'll have to cross over a few streets along the way, but they are neighborhood streets (2 lane) - not a ton of vehicle traffic.
### Other amenities:
If you're looking for a playground - this park does indeed have one, and it's close to the bathrooms and covered picnic areas. It has a few swings and a play set.
